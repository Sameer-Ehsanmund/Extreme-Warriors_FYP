# Extreme Warriors_FYP
 The project is based upon an Android-based game including animated characters that fight each other depending upon their moves and strengths provided to them. The game includes different chapters (levels) which define the progress of the player. These levels are achieved when the player defeats another player (enemy). Players will be able to connect via the internet and can also play the game individually (i.e., in offline mode). The game is 3D in nature and is developed in a software called “Unity”; this means that the player will be able to move in all the directions (i.e., x, y, and z-axis). The characters (players and enemies) will be designed in a 3D software “Blender”. This game shall be played offline and online (multiplayer) as well. The functionalities of the characters and the chapters played by the players are dependent upon animations, affects, graphics and overall structure of the game. Unity uses “C Sharp” as its running programming language. Hence, an Android game application will be developed at the end of this work.
